Today we took all our equipment and furniture out of our rooms which
will be used by a tango school afterwards. We are looking forward to get
our new rooms refurbished (and there is plenty of work to do by
ourselves like bruteforcing out all glass-brick-windows and painting
walls). Our new leased premises will be below the surface, yet having
some light through new windows. Our address will remain the very same.
