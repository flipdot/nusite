Just purchased QkCtrl Serial BT ([Android
market](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.kvndev.android.two),
[developer website](http://www.kvndev.com/android/two)), an little App
for changing Your phone into an BT remote control. You can define keys
which are sending control characters to your AVR. First testings seem to
be successfull.
