from german cheapo - supplier Pollin. I don't wanted to waste a USB
connector for the touch input and also I'm planning to use the display
with Python in text mode. Because I couldn't find a driver for this
usecase I decided to do my own stuff.

Original touch controller with USB to be replaced.

Here you have
[touch.zip](https://flipdot.org/blog/uploads/touch.zip "touch.zip"),
containing the
[BASCOM](http://mcselec.com/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1)
source for the Attiny85, corresponding HEX file, quick and dirty Python
test program and lcd.py module containing some VT100 shortcuts. The
Attiny is set to 8 Mhz internal RC clock and brownout detection for 2,7
V. It runs nicely with the 3V3 supply of the Pi and therefore doesn't
need a level shifter.

Final touch controller on perfboard.

The controller in the first step connects the X-resistor-plane to VCC
and GND using port b3 and b1 and then measures the voltage at one
terminal of the Y-plane. This A/D-input also is connected to VCC via an
internal pullup resistor to acieve a full scale reading if no touch
(i.e. no connection between X and Y plane). Afterwards X and Y is
swapped and treated accordingly. The controller sends the x,y coordinate
as raw A/D-converter values. Calibration and calculation of touched
character position is done by the Python script. If you touch the
surface of the panel, there will be a "503,220" on the serial line for
example. If you remove your finger, the controller will transmit the
text "RELEASE". That'sall.
